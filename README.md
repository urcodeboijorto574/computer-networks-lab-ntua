# Computer Networks Lab - NTUA

## Description

In the Computer Networks lab, I gained hands-on experience with routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, and BGP. I learned about bridges, switches, and routers,
their roles in efficient data transmission, and how they enable network connectivity.

The lab also covered essential topics such as Firewalls, NAT translation, network types (such as NAT networks, internal networks, etc),
IPv6, and the functioning of internet services.

Overall, the lab enhanced my understanding of computer networks, equipping me with practical skills in designing, configuring,
and troubleshooting network infrastructures.
